# Terao's conjecture over ℚ: the non-free member as a rational dynamical system

**Status (15 Oct 2026).** Not a proof of TC(ℚ). This note looks for a *global* reason why a
counterexample over ℚ cannot exist. It finds one global object behind every non-free
realisation, and turns it into five theorems:

- **Theorem A (§1).** Yoshinaga's criterion is a statement about rational maps.
  - A line H jumps iff it carries a rational self-map of degree d₁ − 1.
  - That map fixes every multiple point of H, with local degree ≥ m_P − 1, so points with
    m_P ≥ 3 are *superattracting* fixed points.
  - The minimal derivation of a non-free member induces such a map Φ_H on **every line at once**.
  - The Camacho–Sad index of the foliation is the holomorphic fixed-point index of Φ_H.
  - Consequence (Lemma A2): a line all of whose points are at least triple has at most e₁ points.
- **Theorem B (§2).** On a 4-point line, the jump positions are exactly the *critically fixed*
  rational maps with the given critical profile.
  - Such maps are classified by planar graphs (Cordwell–Gilbertson–Nuechterlein–Pilgrim–Pinella,
    Hlushchanka).
  - The planar-graph count reproduces the degree of every jump polynomial: all 136 balanced vectors
    with K even and K ≤ 20, no mismatch.
  - It explains the jump sets computed in `TC_RATIONAL.md`. For example (4,4,4,4) = K₄
    (equianharmonic) + six doubled 4-cycles (ℚ(√21)), and (D, D, 1, 1) = z^D for every D.
- **Theorem C (§3).** The residual inflection curve J′ = J/Q meets each line exactly in:
  - the excess ramification of Φ_H at the multiple points;
  - the fixed points of Φ_H off the arrangement;
  - the free critical points of Φ_H.

  So one quartic (at 17 lines) interpolates all seventeen line maps. In R₁₇ᵃ and R₁₇ᵇ the conic
  factor of J′ carries the free critical points.
- **Theorem E (§4).** Inside a family through free points, a non-free point is a *simultaneous
  tangency*: the jump function of every line vanishes there to order ≥ 2. So it is a singular
  point of the realisation space (the mechanism of the known Ziegler pairs), or every line's jump
  divisor pulls back non-reduced.
- **New ℚ-statements.**
  - TC(ℚ) holds for every lattice, of any size n ≡ 3 (mod 4), that has a 4-point line with
    multiplicities (D, D, 1, 1) (§2).
  - In the 17-line window, every line through the jumping point P₀ of a rational non-free member
    has exactly 7 points, one of them a double point (§1, §5).
    - Six-point lines through P₀ are critically fixed maps of degree 6. Over ℚ their 24 to 40
      positions are all irrational (exact, by msolve). For 9 of the 16 vectors they are not even
      real.
    - On seven-point lines through P₀ the vectors (4, 2⁶) and (3², 2⁵) are impossible.

§5 assembles these into the global argument over ℚ and marks, step by step, what is proved and
what is heuristic. §6 states the three precise statements that would turn it into a proof.

Notation as in `TC_RATIONAL.md` and `TC_FOLIATION.md`:
- L is a lattice of n lines with χ₀ = (t − d₁)(t − d₂);
- A₁ is free and A₂ is not;
- r = mdr(A₂) ≤ d₁ − 1, and θ ∈ D₀(A₂) is the derivation of degree r;
- for a line H, k_P = m_P − 1 are the Ziegler multiplicities of its points P, s = s_H is their number,
  and K = Σ k_P = n − 1;
- (e₁(H), e₂(H)) are the exponents of (A^H, k);
- (s : t) are coordinates on H, and α_P = s − p t for P = (p : 1).

## 0. The idea

A non-free realisation is usually pictured as a "special position", one coincidence per line,
and Yoshinaga's criterion makes these coincidences equivalent. That picture hides the structure.

The obstruction to freeness is one global object, the derivation θ of degree r < d₁. On each line
it is a rational map with prescribed superattracting fixed points. So the question becomes:

> can one incidence structure carry, in one rational realisation, a coherent system of ℚ-rational
> dynamical systems of degree d₁ − 1 (one on each line, glued by one foliation), and in another
> realisation none at all?

Dynamics on P¹ is rigid in exactly the cases that matter. Maps whose critical points are all fixed
form a finite set, classified by planar graphs (Thurston rigidity). Over ℚ, the few that are
rational sit at symmetric positions in every case computed. The rest of this note makes that
precise and says how far it goes.

## 1. Line maps (Theorem A)

For a pair of binary forms (f, g) of degree e, write h = gcd(f, g), (f, g) = h·(f′, g′), and
Φ = [f′ : g′] : P¹ → P¹. The derivation f∂_s + g∂_t sends α_P to f − p g = h·(f′ − p g′).

**Theorem A.** f∂_s + g∂_t lies in D(A^H, k)_e iff for every point P of H

  ord_P(h) + ord_P(f′ − p g′) ≥ k_P.

Here ord_P(f′ − p g′) > 0 iff Φ(P) = P, and then it equals the local degree of Φ at P. In
particular, when gcd(f, g) = 1, every multiple point of H is a fixed point of Φ of local degree
≥ k_P, and the points with m_P ≥ 3 are superattracting.

*Proof.* If g′(P) = 0 then f′(P) ≠ 0, so f′ − p g′ does not vanish at P and Φ(P) = ∞ ≠ P.
Otherwise Φ − p = (f′ − p g′)/g′ near P, which vanishes at P iff Φ(P) = P, to order equal to
the local degree. (For P = ∞ exchange the roles of s and t.) ∎

**Corollary A1 (Yoshinaga's criterion, dynamically).** A realisation of L is free iff one
(equivalently every) line H carries no nonzero (f, g) of degree d₁ − 1 as in Theorem A.

*Proof.* By Yoshinaga, freeness is e₁(H) = d₁, and e₁(H) ≤ d₁ always holds since e₁e₂ ≤ d₁d₂. ∎

**The global form.** Let K_H = θ(α_H)/α_H and θ_H = θ − K_H·E. Then θ_H is tangent to H, and its
restriction (f_H, g_H) is a nonzero element of D(A^H, k)_r (`TC_FOLIATION.md` 1.1). So **one
derivation gives a line map Φ_H on every line simultaneously.** Two dictionary entries:
- (a) The fixed points of Φ_H, i.e. the zeros of s·g_H − t·f_H, are the singular points on H of
  the foliation F_θ (`TC_FOLIATION.md` 1.1).
- (b) **Camacho–Sad = holomorphic index.** At a simple fixed point P (Φ_H′(P) ≠ 1) with h(P) ≠ 0,

  CS(F_θ, H, P) = 1 / (1 − Φ_H′(P)).

  *Proof.* Take a chart y = 1 in which P is finite and not a pole of Φ_H, with H = {w = 0}. There
  the planar field is X = (f − u g, −w g) along H.
  The tangential eigenvalue is (f − ug)′(p) = g(p)(Φ′(p) − 1), using f(p) = p g(p). The
  transverse eigenvalue is −g(p). Their ratio is the index. ∎

  So the Camacho–Sad formula Σ_{P∈H} CS = H·H = 1 *is* the holomorphic fixed-point formula
  Σ 1/(1 − Φ′) = 1. And "radial at a point with ≥ 3 lines" (`TC_FOLIATION.md` 1.3(a)) means
  CS = 1, i.e. Φ_H′(P) = 0: superattracting.

**Lemma A2 (lines without double points).** If every point of a multiarrangement on P¹ has
k_P ≥ 2, then s ≤ e₁.

*Proof.* Suppose s ≥ e₁ + 1 and take (f, g) ≠ 0 of degree D = e₁.
1. If s g − t f ≡ 0, then (f, g) = h·(s, t). The conditions give α_P^{k_P − 1} | h for every P, so
   D − 1 ≥ Σ(k_P − 1) ≥ s ≥ D + 1. This is a contradiction.
2. So W = s g − t f is a nonzero form of degree D + 1 vanishing at the s ≥ D + 1 points. Hence
   s = D + 1, and every zero of W is simple and is a point of H.
3. W = h·(s g′ − t f′). A zero P of h therefore has ord_P(f′ − p g′) = 0, which forces
   k_P ≤ ord_P h = 1. So h = 1.
4. Now Φ has degree D, and all D + 1 fixed points are superattracting.
   - D = 1 is impossible, since a Möbius map has no critical point.
   - For D ≥ 2 the holomorphic fixed-point formula gives Σ 1/(1 − 0) = D + 1 = 1. Contradiction. ∎

*Consequences.*
- In any arrangement, a line all of whose points are at least triple has s_H ≤ e₁(H) ≤ mdr.
- In the 17-line window of `TC_FILTER.md`, take A₂ (r = 7, jumping point P₀):
  - An 8-point line has a double point. This recovers the exclusion of (2⁸) in Lemma F1 there,
    without Wakefield–Yuzvinsky.
  - A 7-point line through P₀ has e₁ = 6 (`TC_FOLIATION.md` Lemma 10.3), so it too has a double
    point. The vectors (4,2,2,2,2,2,2) and (3,3,2,2,2,2,2) cannot occur on a line through P₀. This
    is new; the (6, 10) loci of 7-point lines were never computed.

**Check** (`work/global/linemaps.m2`), on R₁₇ᵃ and R₁₇ᵇ, all 34 lines:
- Φ_H has degree 7 and gcd(f_H, g_H) = 1 on every line;
- every multiple point is fixed, with local degree ≥ m_P − 1;
- where the local degree exceeds m_P − 1, the excess is accounted for by Theorem C.

## 2. Four-point lines are critically fixed maps (Theorem B)

A rational map is *critically fixed* if each of its critical points is a fixed point. Such maps
are postcritically finite, so by Thurston rigidity there are finitely many in each degree, up to
Möbius conjugacy. Cordwell, Gilbertson, Nuechterlein, Pilgrim and Pinella (2015) and
Hlushchanka (2019) classify them by the Pilgrim–Tan blow-up construction:

> critically fixed maps of degree D, up to conjugacy ⟷ connected planar loopless multigraphs with
> D − 1 edges, up to orientation-preserving homeomorphism of S².

Under this correspondence a vertex of valence v is a critical fixed point of local degree v + 1.
The other fixed points of a critically fixed map are repelling, since every attracting or
parabolic cycle attracts a critical point. So they are simple, and there are D + 1 − c of them,
where c is the number of critical points.

**Theorem B.** Let k = (k₁, …, k₄) be a balanced multiplicity on four points, with K = 2d even.
Then e₁ ∈ {d − 1, d}, and the jump set J(k) is in bijection with the pairs (Φ, λ) where:
- Φ is a critically fixed map of degree D = d − 1;
- its critical points are exactly the points with k_i ≥ 2, of local degree exactly k_i;
- λ labels the points with k_i = 1 by distinct non-critical fixed points of Φ;
- pairs are taken modulo automorphisms of Φ that fix its critical points.

These automorphisms are trivial unless c = 2 (Φ = z^D, automorphism group μ_{D−1}). The bijection
sends (Φ, λ) to the cross-ratio of the four labelled points. Hence

  |J(k)| = (number of planar graphs with valences k_i − 1) · (D + 1 − c)!/(D − 3)!  (÷ (D − 1) when c = 2).

*Proof.*
1. *e₁ ≥ d − 1.* This is Abe's bound |e₂ − e₁| ≤ s − 2 = 2.
2. *The jump gives a map with no common factor.* A jump gives (f, g) of degree D in
   D(k)_{d−1} (Theorem A). Write (f, g) = h·(f′, g′) with h = ∏ α_i^{a_i}; zeros of h away from
   the four points only waste degree. Then Φ = [f′ : g′] has degree D − e, e = Σ a_i, and needs
   ramification Σ (k_i − a_i − 1)⁺ ≥ Σ (k_i − 1) − e = 2D − 2 − e. Riemann–Hurwitz allows only
   2(D − e) − 2. So e = 0.
3. *The local degrees are exact.* Riemann–Hurwitz again: Σ (k_i − 1) = 2d − 4 = 2D − 2. So the
   local degrees are exactly k_i and there are no other critical points; Φ is critically fixed.
4. *Conversely,* such a Φ and λ give (f, g) in D(k)_{d−1} by Theorem A. The configuration
   determines Φ, because the kernel at a jump point is one-dimensional (Abe's bound). The count
   then follows from the classification. ∎

**Verification** (`work/global/charge_graphs.py`). The script enumerates the planar multigraphs
and compares the predicted |J(k)| with the number of interior roots of the jump polynomial of
`work/rational/jump4_all.out`. All roots there are simple. Result: **all 136 balanced vectors
with K even, K ≤ 20, match exactly.** (Beyond K = 20 the brute-force rotation enumeration is too
slow; it is not a limitation of the theorem.)

**What it explains.**

| vector k | graphs | jump set |
|---|---|---|
| (3,3,3,3) | the three 4-cycles | {−1, 2, ½} |
| (4,4,4,4) | K₄ (two mirror embeddings) + six doubled 4-cycles | t² − t + 1, and one S₃-orbit in ℚ(√21) |
| (5,5,5,1) | the doubled triangle, one embedding (S₃-symmetric map) | its five non-critical fixed points: −1, 2, ½ and the roots of t² − t + 1 |
| (D, D, 1, 1) | D − 1 parallel edges: Φ = z^D | μ_{D−1} ∖ {1}, the nontrivial (D − 1)-th roots of unity |

The last line holds **for every D**: J(1, 1, D, D) = μ_{D−1} ∖ {1}. The jump polynomials of
`jump4_all.out` show it for D = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and D = 14, e.g. Φ₁₃ at K = 30. It is a rational
statement for all n at once.

**Corollary B1 (TC(ℚ), any number of lines).** Let L be a lattice with n ≡ 3 (mod 4) lines and a
line with four points of Ziegler multiplicities (D, D, 1, 1), D = (n − 3)/2. Then all realisations
of L over ℚ have the same freeness.

*Proof.* D is even, so μ_{D−1} contains no rational number other than 1. Then J has no rational
point, and Lemma 2.1 of `TC_RATIONAL.md` applies. ∎

This extends Theorem 3.2(b) of `TC_RATIONAL.md`, which needed n ≤ 27, for this vector, to all n.

**Galois and reality.** The set of critically fixed maps with a given labelled profile is
Gal(ℚ̄/ℚ)-stable. Complex conjugation acts on the graphs by mirror image. So:
- a jump point is real only if its plane graph is achiral. K₄ is chiral, hence the non-real
  equianharmonic pair; the doubled 4-cycles are achiral and their jump points are all real;
- a jump point is rational only if its map is Galois-invariant.

All rational jump points up to K = 30 are harmonic. For vectors with a multiplicity-preserving
symmetry this has a clear source: the map commutes with an involution fixing two of the points
and swapping the other two, which forces cross-ratio −1. But (2, 8, 9, 11) and (4, 6, 7, 13) at
K = 30, with all multiplicities distinct, show that symmetry of the labelled configuration is not
the only source. Which planar graphs give Galois-invariant maps is the same kind of question as
for dessins d'enfants, and is open. This is where "rational ⟹ harmonic" for all K would have to
come from (§6, (M3)).

**The harmonic maps of the 17-line window** (`work/global/harmonic_maps.m2`). Coordinates z = x/y,
with the points at 0, ∞, 1, t in the order of the vector.

| vector (window order) | t | critical points (local degree) | non-critical fixed points other than the double point |
|---|---|---|---|
| (5,5,5,1) | −1 | ∞, 1, −1 (5 each); double point at 0 | 3, −3, ±√−3 |
| (5,5,3,3) | −1 | 1, −1 (5); 0, ∞ (3) | roots of z⁴ + 22z² + 1 (none rational) |
| (5,4,4,3) | 2 | 2 (5); ∞, 1 (4); 0 (3) | 4, 4/3, and the roots of z² − z + 1 |

By Theorem C these are exactly the points where the quartic J′ of a rational A₂ meets such a line.

## 3. The inflection curve interpolates the line maps (Theorem C)

Let J = det(E, θ, θ(θ)) be the inflection curve of the foliation of θ (`TC_FOLIATION.md` §2).
It has degree 3r, is unchanged by θ ↦ θ + aE, and factors as J = Q·J′ with deg J′ = j = 3r − n.

**Theorem C.** Let θ be a derivation of A of degree r with saturated foliation, H a line of A,
and (f, g) = θ_H|_H. Then, as binary forms on H,

  (J/α_H)|_H = c_H · (s g − t f) · Jac(f, g),  c_H ∈ ℚ*,  Jac(f, g) = f_s g_t − f_t g_s.

If gcd(f, g) = 1, then dividing by (Q/α_H)|_H = ∏_P α_P^{k_P} gives

  J′|_H = c_H · ∏_P α_P^{ν_P − k_P} · W_off · R_free,

where:
- ν_P ≥ k_P is the local degree of Φ_H at P;
- W_off (degree r + 1 − s_H) vanishes at the fixed points of Φ_H off the arrangement;
- R_free vanishes at the critical points of Φ_H off the arrangement.

**In words:** J′ ∩ H = (excess ramification at the multiple points) + (other fixed points) +
(free critical points). The total is j on every line.

*Proof.*
1. In the chart y = 1 with H = {w = 0}, let u be the coordinate along H. Then the planar field is
   X = (f − u g, −w g) along H. In the notation of `TC_FOLIATION.md` Lemma 10.4(b) this means
   A = f − u g and B = −g, and that lemma gives J = (r + 1)·w·A·(AB′ − A′B + B²) + O(w²).
2. With Φ = f/g one finds AB′ − A′B + B² = g²Φ′ = f′g − f g′.
3. Homogenising, A becomes −(s g − t f), and f′g − f g′ becomes Jac(f, g)/r (Euler's identity).
4. For the second form, s g − t f = ∏_P α_P · W_off and Jac(f, g) = ∏_P α_P^{ν_P − 1} · R_free.
   Divide by ∏ α_P^{k_P}. ∎

If gcd(f, g) = h, which happens on a line through a Bourbaki point, then
Jac(hF, hG) = ((D + 1)/D)·h²·Jac(F, G) for linear h and deg F = D. So h enters (J/α_H)|_H to the
power 3.

**Verification** (`work/global/jprime_lines.m2`). The first identity holds exactly on all
17 + 17 + 9 lines of R₁₇ᵃ, R₁₇ᵇ and B₃.

**Examples.**
- **R₁₇ᵃ, line y = 0.** It has eight points. The excess ramification sits at (4:0:1) and
  (8:0:1), exactly where the two rich lines x − y − 4z and x − 4y − 8z cross it. The two free
  critical points are 2s² − 11st + 20t² = 0, which is the trace of the conic factor
  2x² − 2xy + 2y² − 11xz + 10yz + 20z² of J′.
- **Pattern in R₁₇ᵃ and R₁₇ᵇ.** In both arrangements:
  - the conic carries the free critical points of the 7- and 8-point lines;
  - the lines with 5 or 6 points have *critically fixed* maps. Their free critical points are all
    absorbed by excess at multiple points; for example the 5-point line z of R₁₇ᵃ has excess 1 at
    the point (1:1:0).
- **The four-point lines of a rational A₂ in the 17-line window.** By §2, J′ meets such a line
  exactly in the four repelling fixed points of its critically fixed map: the last column of the
  table in §2.

**What C adds.** Yoshinaga makes the jump conditions of the n lines equivalent, so they cannot be
counted as independent. Theorem C says what does tie the lines together: a single curve of degree
j = 3r − n (a quartic at 17 lines) passes through the "dynamical residue" of every line map. On a
4-point line that residue is determined by the jump position alone. A plane quartic is fixed by
14 general points, and four lines in general position carry 16 points of it. So four small lines
of a non-free A₂ pin down J′, and every other line must reproduce it.

## 4. Inside a family, a jump is a simultaneous tangency (Theorem E)

For a line H, write Θ_H for its jump function. For d₁ = d₂ = d this is the determinant of the
K × K matrix of the degree-(d − 1) Ziegler conditions, a function of the positions on H.

**Theorem E.** Let d₁ = d₂, let C be an irreducible component of the realisation space of L that
contains a free point, and let A₀ ∈ C be non-free with C smooth at A₀. Then for every line H,
Θ_H ∘ π_H lies in m²_{A₀}. Hence:
- every component N₁ of the non-free locus of C with N₁ ⊄ Sing C appears with multiplicity ≥ 2
  in div(Θ_H ∘ π_H), for every line H;
- if, for one line H, π_H*(J_H) is reduced in the interior of C, then every smooth point of C
  is free.

*Proof.* Let γ be an arc through A₀ that is not contained in the non-free locus.
1. Say the exponents of H at A₀ are (d − j_H, d + j_H). If j_H ≥ 2, the K × K matrix has a kernel
   of dimension j_H at t = 0, so its determinant vanishes to order ≥ j_H ≥ 2.
2. If j_H = 1, `TC_RIGIDITY.md` Lemma 3 gives ord_t Θ_H(π_H(γ(t))) = ord_t c(t) ≥ 2, where c is
   the Saito determinant of the family. Its proof uses only that the family of logarithmic
   bundles is flat with generically split fibre.
3. If d(Θ_H ∘ π_H)(A₀) ≠ 0, then an arc with γ′(0) ∉ ker d(Θ_H ∘ π_H) has order 1, a
   contradiction. ∎

**Readings.**
- **Over ℂ.** A non-free point inside a free family is either a singular point of the
  realisation space, or a point where the family is tangent to the jump locus of every line.
  - The first is the mechanism of every known Ziegler pair: in Barakat–Kühne–Pokora, two surfaces
    of realisations cross along a conic on which a hidden collinearity holds, and Θ = g₁g₂
    vanishes doubly there.
  - The second never occurs in the families computed so far. In the 13- and 15-line families of
    `TC_RIGIDITY.md` §3 every jump function factors into boundary factors.
- **On a 4-point line.** All roots of the jump polynomial are simple. This is the data for
  K ≤ 30, consistent with Epstein's transversality theorem for postcritically finite maps. So tangency means the
  cross-ratio function λ_H : C → P¹ is *stationary* at A₀: dλ_H = 0. Over ℚ this is a rational
  critical point of λ_H whose critical value is harmonic.

## 5. The argument over ℚ

Let (A₁, A₂) be a counterexample over ℚ with lattice L and χ₀ = (t − d₁)(t − d₂). Each step below
is labelled by its status. Specialisations to the open 17-line class (8, 8)[B] are in brackets.

**Step 1 — A₂ is a rational dynamical system** [proved].
- D₀(A₂)_r is a ℚ-vector space, so θ can be taken rational. On every line H it induces a line
  map Φ_H ∈ ℚ(z) whose fixed points contain all multiple points, superattracting of local degree
  ≥ m_P − 1 (Theorem A).
- Its degree is r, or r − z(H) after the Bourbaki factor is removed (`TC_FOLIATION.md`
  Lemma 10.2).
- The Bourbaki scheme and J′ are defined over ℚ.
- A₁ carries no such map in degree d₁ − 1 on any line (Corollary A1).
- [17 lines: deg Φ_H = 7 on lines missing P₀ and 6 on lines through it; P₀ ∈ P²(ℚ); J′ is a
  rational quartic singular at P₀.]

**Step 2 — the small lines of A₂ are arithmetically rigid** [structure proved, rationality computed].
- **4-point lines.** Φ_H is one of the finitely many critically fixed maps of its profile
  (Theorem B), and it is ℚ-rational. For K ≤ 30 the rational ones sit only at harmonic positions
  (`TC_RATIONAL.md` Theorem 3.1).
  [17 lines: vectors (5,5,5,1), (5,5,3,3), (5,4,4,3) only, at the positions of the table in §2.]
- **5-point lines.** Φ_H has one free critical point and lies on a jump curve of geometric genus
  ≥ 3, so there are finitely many rational ones (Faltings). The ones found have small height
  (`TC_RATIONAL.md` §4).
- **Lines through P₀** [17 lines, new].
  - **Six points.** A line through P₀ has e₁ = 6, so its lowest Ziegler element is a
    critically fixed map of degree 6: Σ(k_P − 1) = 10 = 2·6 − 2, and common factors are excluded
    as in Theorem B. So it is one of finitely many, counted by planar graphs with five edges (for
    (3,3,3,3,2,2): the 24 labelled paths). This explains the "finitely many positions" of
    `TC_FILTER.md` Lemma F1.
    - **Counts.** For all sixteen 6-point vectors the planar-graph count (24, 36 or 40,
      `charge_six.out`) equals the degree of the (6, 10) locus computed directly
      (`sixpoint_modp.out`).
    - **Over ℚ** (`sixpoint_exact.m2`, exact). msolve's rational univariate representation of
      each locus has an eliminant with **no linear factor over ℚ**. The Galois orbits have sizes 4
      to 36, and for nine vectors no position is even real (`sixpoint_rational.out`).

    So **over ℚ no line through P₀ has 6 points**.
  - **Seven points.** Then the line contains a double point (Lemma A2).
  - **Conclusion** [17 lines, ℚ, proved]. With `TC_FILTER.md` (P₀ is on no 4- or 5-point line),
    every line of A₂ through P₀ has exactly 7 points, one of them double. Possibly no line of A₂
    passes through P₀ at all, as in R₁₇ᵃ and R₁₇ᵇ.

**Step 3 — one curve glues the line maps** [proved].
- On every line, J′ ∩ H is the dynamical residue of Φ_H (Theorem C).
- [17 lines: on a 4-point line J′ passes through the four repelling fixed points of the
  critically fixed map. Four small lines determine J′. Its line components are the rich lines,
  at most four (`TC_CONTRADICTION.md`).]

**Step 4 — where the free mate can be** [proved].
- **Type I** (different components): every line separates the two components (`TC_RIGIDITY.md`
  Lemma 1(b)). On a 4-point line the non-free component sits at one harmonic value, and the free
  one avoids every jump value.
- **Type II** (same component): A₂ is a simultaneous tangency (Theorem E). Either the realisation
  space is singular at A₂, or on every 4-point line the cross-ratio map has a rational critical
  point at A₂ with harmonic critical value.

**Step 5 — why this is too restrictive** [heuristic, not a proof].
- **The two worlds.** Steps 1–3 make a rational non-free member a very rigid object. On its small
  lines it is a symmetric, critically fixed configuration, and one curve of degree 3r − n
  interpolates the residues of all n line maps. Every non-free window arrangement found so far
  is of this kind and is rigid: R₁₇ᵃ and R₁₇ᵇ over ℚ, E₁₇ and the A(G₂₆) deletions over ℚ(√−3).
  Each realisation space is a single Galois orbit, and TC holds for its lattice by Galois
  invariance.
- **The free side.** The free window arrangements known so far are rigid incidence-theorem
  configurations, or belong to one of two flexible families whose jump functions have only
  boundary zeros. At
  17 lines no free window arrangement is known at all, and over F₁₁ and F₁₃ none exists with a
  4- or 5-point line (`TC_BUILD.md` §5).
- **What a counterexample would need.** One lattice realised in both worlds:
  - type I: a second, unrelated ℚ-component on which every small line is critically fixed;
  - type II: a free family that becomes stationary on every 4-point line at exactly the harmonic
    value.
- **Why this is not a proof.** Yoshinaga's criterion makes all these line conditions consequences
  of a single one. So the restrictiveness cannot be counted as many independent conditions, and
  nothing above rules out either world-crossing for a lattice without small lines. The steps
  narrow where a counterexample can live; they do not empty it.

## 6. What would finish it

(M1) and (M2) are TC(ℚ) itself, split into its two types and restated with the structure of
§1–§4 available as hypotheses. (M3) is a self-contained statement in arithmetic dynamics. On its
own, (M3) confines a rational counterexample, for every n, to harmonic positions on every 4-point
line. Together the three give TC(ℚ).

- **(M1) No interior tangency.** On a component of a realisation space containing a free point,
  the realisation space is smooth along the non-free locus, and some line's jump divisor pulls
  back reduced. By Theorem E this forces the component to be entirely free. This is TC on the
  component in geometric form; it holds in every family computed so far (`TC_RIGIDITY.md` §3).
- **(M2) Symmetric non-free components are isolated.** Suppose a rational realisation is at a
  harmonic, critically fixed position on every 4-point line and at a rational jump point on every
  5-point line. Then its lattice has no other ℚ-component. This is type I with Steps 2–3 as
  hypotheses. It holds for every rational non-free window arrangement known.
- **(M3) Rational critically fixed maps are harmonic.** Let Φ ∈ ℚ(z) be critically fixed, with
  ≤ 4 critical points, and suppose the 4 marked points (the critical points plus, if needed,
  chosen non-critical fixed points) are rational. Then their cross-ratio is harmonic.
  - It is proved here for the family (D, D, 1, 1), via z^D, and checked for all 1,005 vectors with
    K ≤ 30.
  - It is a statement about fields of moduli of planar-graph maps, like Belyi's dessins.
  - It is the most accessible of the three, and p-adic dynamics is the natural tool. Benedetto,
    Ingram, Jones and Levy bound the height of postcritically finite maps over number fields of
    bounded degree, through the p-adic fact that a sufficiently attracting cycle attracts a
    critical point.
  - At a prime p where Φ has good reduction, a superattracting fixed point P̄ of the reduction
    has Φ̄(z) − z vanishing simply. So no other fixed point shares its residue disc.
  - Hence, *if* Φ has potentially good reduction at every p > D, the cross-ratio λ of four marked
    points of which at least three are critical satisfies: λ and 1 − λ are S-units,
    S = {p ≤ D}. This is a finite list, but it contains non-harmonic values such as λ = 3.
  - So this route bounds the problem; it does not close it.

**Concrete next computations.** Each is a computation on one projective line, not a 17-line
enumeration:
- the (6, 10) curves of the 7-point lines through P₀: their genus and rational points. Each such
  curve is a one-parameter family of degree-6 maps with one free critical point;
- the charge-graph count for K > 20, with a smarter enumeration;
- whether the free critical points of the 7- and 8-point lines of a rational A₂ always lie on the
  non-linear part of J′, as in R₁₇ᵃ and R₁₇ᵇ.
